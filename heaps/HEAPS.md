# Heaps
> A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:
>  * **Max-Heap**: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.ds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
> * **Min-Heap**: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
