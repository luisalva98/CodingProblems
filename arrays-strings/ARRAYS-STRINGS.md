# Arrays
> An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. 
> The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. 
> This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

> Types of indexing in array:

> * 0 (zero-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by subscript of 0
> * 1 (one-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by subscript of 1
> * n (n-based indexing): The base index of an array can be freely chosen. Usually programming languages allowing n-based indexing also allow negative index values and other scalar data types like enumerations, or characters may be used as an array index.

> Advantages of using arrays:

 > * Arrays allow random access of elements. This makes accessing elements by position faster.
> * Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.


# Strings
> Strings are defined as an array of characters.
> Strings are mostly considered a data type, made up of a data structure, rather than a data structures itself.
> For the purpose of algorithms, they are very similar to an array of characters.
> The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’.
> Declaring a string is as simple as declaring a one dimensional array in a language like c, for example. .
