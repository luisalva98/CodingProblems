# Binary Tree
> Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures.
> A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. 
> It is implemented mainly using Links.
> A Binary Tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node in the tree. 
> If the tree is empty, then the value of root is NULL. A Binary Tree node contains the following parts.
```
1. Data
2. Pointer to left child
3. Pointer to the right child
```
